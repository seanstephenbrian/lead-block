# [lead block sports](https://www.leadblocksports.blog/)

this is the front end for **lead block sports**, a full-stack sports blog platform.

the site is built with react and features a completely original design.

all blog data is stored in mongodb. react components make requests to the back-end api,
which i developed with node.js/express, to fetch and render this content as necessary 
as the user navigates the site.

there are basically three "views" offered by the app: single article pages,
search results, and informational pages ("About"/"Contact").

various css animations, hover effects, and other design details make the user
experience more dynamic.
