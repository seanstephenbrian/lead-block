<p>One week removed from the Super Bowl, teams are finally able to focus their full attention to the offseason, and the most important part of the offseason is the NFL draft. Some could argue that free agency is more consequential, as contracts are signed and dumped off that could potentially create or destroy room in the salary cap that the team could use in the future. The draft, however, is where the tangible future of a team is born from the smoldering ashes of their franchise’s past mistakes, and triumphs. The draft is a place where fans can see the building blocks of their team’s future fall into place before their eyes, giving the gift of wild speculation for what the bright future of their shiny new additions may look like.</p>
<p>There is no greater wonder in the league than when a rudderless team decides to lean into a youth movement, and I would argue, no mystery greater in sports than the blueprint to create a successful and competitive NFL roster. There is no blueprint to build a dominant team in the NFL without roster planning founded on principles of foresight and creativity, or without an egregious amount of luck. It is truly an alignment of the stars when an NFL team musters up everything required to win just one Super Bowl, let alone to think of what it takes to build a dynasty.</p>
<p>With all that being said, this year’s draft could prove to be a monumental one for the future of the league. Blue chip defensive prospects like Jalen Carter and Will Anderson Jr. sit atop the class as the pick of the litter, along with a litany of quarterbacks who are highly speculated to be selected in the 1st round. Bryce Young leads the way with his incredible ability to make any throw he wants to, coupled with cerebral ability on par with any one of the quarterbacks in this class or previous.</p>
<p>Rawer, more athletic, and moldable quarterbacks Will Levis and Anthony Richardson both showcased incredible tangibles and God-given ability on the field during college, but lacked the proper mechanics and at times the mental processing to succeed at the level of Young, or even C.J Stroud, whose impeccable accuracy and processing ability lead many to believe he could have immediate as well as long-lasting success under center.</p>
<p>This class is filled with impactful talent all around, especially in a loaded and deep defensive backfield, along with some offensive and defensive linemen who project to be solid NFL players for many years to come. This mock draft will feature some trades, and, I know, it’s impossible to project trades this far ahead of the draft, but I’d like to have some fun with it, and there is a ton of rumblings about movement not only with the #1 overall selection, but several spots in the mid to late round as well. I’ll only be providing analysis for the first 20 picks, after that it will be minimal. I can’t wait for draft day to come, and I hope you guys enjoy my mock! Don’t take it too seriously, this will just be some friendly speculation informed by my accurate and strongly credentialed opinion. : )</p>
<h2>1st pick: Indianapolis selects Bryce Young, QB, Bama (previously owned by Bears)</h2>
<p>The buzz surrounding this pick being traded is as palpable as it has been for any first overall selection in some time, and for good reason. Although Justin Fields didn’t produce quite as much as his team or himself would’ve liked, it’s unquestionable that Fields has something very special going on in Chicago. Talks of trading Fields have gained momentum in the public, but I don’t buy it; they have someone whom they believe in at QB, for the first time, maybe ever, for some fans, and they have fallen into the golden ticket, as there are a plethora of hungry teams ready to pounce on any quality quarterback they can find, especially someone as premium as Young.</p>
<p>As for the Colts, they jump their division peer, Houston, into the #1 spot to take the player of their choosing and force their rival to settle. This move gives them total agency to select whomever they believe worthy, in this case Bryce Young, and gives them arguably the best player in the draft. The likely compensation would include a pick swap, along with potentially several of the Colts’ future and current day two and three selections, whether it be found in 2nd, 3rd, or 4th round picks.</p>
<p>This trade is a no brainer, as the Bears get to add a plethora of picks to build behind Fields, while also remaining in the top 4 to secure a shot at top dogs of the draft. Bears GM Ryan Poles spoke candidly about his approach to building his team, and that includes valuing late round picks and building through the draft, and this gives him the tools to do just that.</p>
<p>The Colts secure their quarterback of the future, while not giving up too many of their future assets to the point where it will drastically affect their future. They have a gaggle of players they could move to recover some of that compensation, and adding a player of Bryce Young’s caliber could have franchise-altering implications. Young is absolutely worth the first overall pick.</p>
<h2>2nd pick: Houston selects Will Levis, QB, Kentucky</h2>
<p>This mock sees the Texans using their first 1st round pick on Will Levis, a player whose assessment has been at times controversial... As a pure quarterback, Levis has produced less than desirable results in showcasing his accuracy, oftentimes the result of poor throwing mechanics or footwork.</p>
<p>He played against the top defenses in the country this year as an SEC QB, and has all the measurables to be a weapon in the modern NFL. At 6’3, 232, he has a body similar to Josh Allen, with eerily similar traits and weaknesses as well. With his rocket arm and athletic makeup, it would be a shame for the Texans to miss out on a player with as much potential as Levis has, and if he is truly awful, they could find themselves in a Josh Rosen/Kyler Murray situation, one where Levis disappoints and the Texans go for a player like Drake Maye or Caleb Williams. Either way, Houston takes a swing on Levis at #2, and hopes to fill their desperate need at QB.</p>
<h2>3rd pick: Arizona selects Will Anderson Jr., EDGE, Bama</h2>
<p>Another no brainer, Arizona really cannot go wrong with either of the players they will get here. If they stay, they’re guaranteed to either have Anderson or Carter fall into their laps, in this case, Anderson. He has the physical tools, the makeup, as well as a similar level of college production as Von Miller, and looks to be a dominant pass rusher for years to come. Consistently playing against the best of the best in the SEC has molded Anderson into a perfect fit for almost any NFL defense, and his addition is one that lays an incredible foundation for the future of the rebuilding Cardinals. Facing the retirement of J.J Watt, and the likely season-long absence of Kyler Murray, he’ll have ample time to become the new face of the Cardinals’ defense and plenty of room to make mistakes to learn from in this early chapter of his career.</p>
<h2>4th pick: Chicago selects Jalen Carter, IDL, Georgia (Previously owned by Indianapolis)</h2>
<p>Chicago gets an absolute steal at the fourth spot, as Carter is considered by many to be the best player in this draft, regardless of position. A bruising interior force on the defensive line, Carter can move anywhere along the inside and dominate from day one. He will face his learning moments, surely, but the pure power and incredible technique he displayed constantly while on the field at Georgia is enough to prove he will be a force in this league for potentially the next decade. As running the ball becomes increasingly more prevalent in the makeup of modern NFL offense, it will be crucial for the Bears to continue rebuilding their disastrous defensive line, one which placed last in sacks (20) and 2nd to last only to the Texans for most rushing yards allowed. Carter is a phenomenal place to start for any team trying to ignite their rebuild.</p>
<h2>Pick #5: Seattle selects Tyree Wilson, EDGE, Texas Tech</h2>
<p>Seattle taking Tyree Wilson at fifth overall seems fitting for a Seahawks team that was abused on the defensive side of the ball. A lengthy, 6’6 275 edge rusher who has a wingspan similar to that of Giannis Antetokounmpo despite being 6 inches shorter, is a dream prospect for any defensive coordinator. He has proven his chops both in the run and pass game, using his length and power to shed blocks and disrupt run plays as well as his athleticism and technique while rushing. Seattle has a long way to go, but bolstering their defensive line with a freak athlete can never hurt.</p>
<h2>Pick #6: Detroit selects Devon Witherspoon, DB, Illinois</h2>
<p>The production of Jeff Okudah has been disappointing to say the least, whether it be due to injury or just a failure to launch. With Witherspoon, you get an incredibly physical corner who plays the run game and the flat extraordinarily well. His man coverage is bolstered by his ample ball skills, and instincts to read routes and stick to his man deep down the field. He’s a little bit too aggressive at times, but his defensive IQ and his ability to see field as a defensive back are invaluable and will be a great addition to a secondary that struggled mightily at times during the 2022 season.</p>
<h2>Pick #7: Oakland selects C.J. Stroud, QB, Ohio State</h2>
<p>Stroud falling to number seven for the Raiders feels like a gift from the football gods. Although he may not be as exceptional of a playmaker as Bryce Young, Stroud showed that he was an extremely accurate thrower whom you could rely on to anticipate tough throws and trust the structure of his offense. He was able to execute and read the field at a high level while playing at Ohio State, but time will tell if he will be able to do the same thing against NFL defenses, without the bountiful talent of OSU around him. He may struggle to decipher higher-level concepts and will need to prove himself as a playmaker outside of the pocket and the structure of the designed play, but he proved he has the capability to play exceptionally well on the biggest stages.</p>
<h2>Pick #8: Atlanta selects Paris Johnson Jr., OT, Ohio State</h2>
<p>The Falcons did not choose to extend the fifth year option for OT Kaleb McGary, and if they don’t come to a deal with him, they will be without one of the best tackles of the 2022 season and one of the most excellent run blockers in the league. Johnson looks to be a bit of a project, but has the athleticism and frame to become a quality tackle. He also has the potential to play inside if need be, and once he gets a little bit stronger and adjusted to NFL talent, he’ll be a staple for Atlanta’s offensive line and a great replacement for McGary.</p>
<h2>Pick #9: Carolina selects Anthony Richardson, QB, Florida</h2>
<p>Richardson, just a 21 year old and a one year starter, absolutely oozes potential. He has as big of an arm as anyone in the draft, and can easily push the ball deep downfield, as well as fit it into tight windows with zip on the ball. He’s also an extremely gifted runner, recording 630 yards on the ground as well as 9 touchdowns in his only year starting for the Gators. He is able to translate his mobility into largely positive results as a passer as well, showcasing a willingness to keep looking downfield while scrambling and looking to pass before deciding to tuck it and run. He’s also struggled mightily at times with his accuracy, and despite showing some great signs in terms of his development with reading the defense, he’ll still have a long way to go to refine his decision making.</p>
<p>Richardson is the rawest prospect of the big 4, but he may also have the highest ceiling. Frank Reich has had offensive savvy throughout his career, reaching top ten levels in scoring behind the play of QBs like an aging Phillip Rivers or Carson Wentz. He looks to inject a fireball into the offense in Richardson, behind an offensive line that finished off the season fairly well, and a great run game to boot. If the Panthers surround him with the right talent and give him time to develop, he could become a potential MVP candidate.</p>
<h2>Pick #10: Philadelphia selects Christian Gonzales, DB, Oregon</h2>
<p>Coming off of an incredible Super Bowl run that saw the Eagles dominate most of the teams they faced down the stretch, there doesn’t seem to be much to drastically improve on this roster. However, DB James Bradberry signed a one-year deal last year, and has definitely played himself into another big contract, one that Philly can’t afford. There is no one better to replace the 2022 second team All-Pro than Gonzales, a speedy, lengthy, athletic corner who has phenomenal ball skills and great instincts in man coverage. He is a little bit unpolished, but with a great 6’1, 200-pound frame, a quality coaching staff can turn him into a dominant corner given the right amount of time. He has Olympic track level speed, and looks to add great value to an already dominant Eagles defense.</p>
<h2>Pick #11: Tennessee selects Peter Skoronski, OT, Northwestern</h2>
<p>Taylor Lewan’s time as a Titan is coming to an end after his ACL injury, and they desperately need a replacement. Landing someone as quality as the Northwestern tackle is just what the doctor ordered for Tennessee, and great value at the pick. He’s got great versatility and could be equally as effective as a guard. He has smaller arms than usual for a tackle, but his track record shows that he has no problem dealing with some of the biggest, most athletic pass rushers the B1G 10 had to offer. He’s got great technique and feet and will have an easy time transitioning into the league. The Titans are facing a looming rebuild, and Skoronski will be a good starter for them for a long time.</p>
<h2>Pick #12: Houston selects Jordan Addison, WR, USC (Previously owned by CLE)</h2>
<p>Houston takes advantage of the haul they got from the Deshaun Watson trade to give their brand-new quarterback a weapon. With Brandin Cooks likely on the outs, this receiving core is one of the thinnest in the league, and adding a player like Addison is a great place to start building it up. He’s a little bit on the smaller side, but his tape looks great, barring a few tough drops both at Pittsburgh and USC. He’s an excellent route runner who is great with the ball in his hands and has very good instincts when reading the leverage he’s given in the secondary. Addison made some incredible catches in college, and he looks to be a playmaker for the Texans new offense powered by Levis.</p>
<h2>Pick #13: NY Jets select Broderick Jones, OT, Georgia</h2>
<p>The Jets desperately need some consistency at both tackles, and 2020 first round pick Mekhi Becton has faced a significant injury in every season he’s played thus far. Broderick Jones is a monster with a compact 6’4 315 lb. frame, and he has been a physically imposing force at his very best. He has tremendous athleticism which allows him great movement into the second level and on zone run schemes, or play designs that get him on the move. He has incredible strength and technique and showed what he was made of playing against a slew of future NFL edge rushers and defensive lineman in the SEC. Jones is a great piece to add, and the Jets could quietly have a resurgent offensive line if the rest of their unit can stay healthy.</p>
<h2>Pick #14: New England Patriots select Zay Flowers, WR, Boston College</h2>
<p>Mac Jones struggled both with injuries and on the field in 2022, and the Patriots offense looked uninspired. They lack any real playmakers outside of Jakobi Meyers, who is a pending free agent. Zay Flowers has been flying up draft boards after an impressive Shrine Bowl performance, and he is exactly the type of player who can inject life into the Patriots offense. Although he has a small catch radius, and is fairly undersized at 5’9 and only 182 lb., he makes up for it with his elite skillset. He has blazing speed with the ball in his hands and is incredibly dangerous after the catch. He’s a perfect player for the Patriot’s to put some pressure off of Mac Jones and gives him a weapon who can make plays.</p>
<h2>Pick #15: Green Bay selects Quinton Johnson, WR, TCU</h2>
<p>The Packers struggled last season until they could establish themselves on the ground later in the season, and that was largely due to a lack of weapons for Rodgers to throw to. Christian Watson exploded onto the scene for the WR room during the second half of the season, including a game where he tallied three touchdowns. Green Bay will need a lot more to support a modern offense though, and the 6’4, 215 lb. 21 year old is an athletic freak who has all the tools to be an elite WR1. He can jump out of the arena and has great route running skills, creating separation with ease. A dynamic runner with the ball in his hands, he can practically do whatever you need him to. He’ll need to develop a little bit on his ability to read the field as a wide receiver, but he’s got the instincts and the frame to be the best WR in this class.</p>
<h2>Pick #16: Washington selects Bryan Bresee, IDL, Clemson</h2>
<p>Bresee is the biggest anomaly in this draft to me. His profile screams top 10 pick, but he has lacked any sort of production this year, and has some serious flaws as well. His 6’5, 305 lb. frame and elite strength gives him the ability to dominate in the interior, and he has the potential to be a top 5 talent in the draft if he can put it together. There are issues with his durability after a torn ACL, and he often plays with his pad level far too high, frequently losing leverage. I put him here at sixteen because he could go anywhere from pick seven to pick 31, and also due to Daron Payne’s impending free agency.</p>
<h2>Pick #17: Pittsburgh Selects Joey Porter Jr., DB, Penn State</h2>
<p>Porter Jr. is the son of former Steelers legend, LB Joey Porter, and the fit here seems perfect. He’s got good graces with the folks who run the team, and he fits the defense well. The Steelers arguably land the top defensive back in the draft, a player who has an ideal 6’2, 198 lb. frame and explosive athleticism coupled with elite instincts. He’s a little bit slower than you would like, but he is a great, physical corner who can play both the run and the pass effectively, and will fit seamlessly into the Steelers’ secondary.</p>
<h2>Pick #18: Detroit selects Calijah Kancey, IDL, Pitt</h2>
<p>Detroit, having taken Weatherspoon earlier, now need to shift their focus onto their front seven, and Calijah Kancey looks like a great addition to a defensive line already bolstered by Aidan Hutchinson. It’s hard to compare anyone to Aaron Donald, but the circumstances both players entered the league are eerily similar. Kancey is an undersized, incredibly productive interior defensive lineman both in the pass rush and the run game. At just 6’0, 280 lb., he is vastly smaller than most NFL nose tackles, but that doesn’t matter for him. It’s incredibly clear that Kancey has the speed, athleticism, technique, and strength to be a serious problem for quarterbacks and running backs alike.</p>
<h2>Pick #19: Tampa Bay TRADES to Chicago, Chicago selects Jaxon Smith-Njigba, WR, Ohio State</h2>
<p>Tampa Bay needs to take a top-to-bottom look at their roster after the retirement of Tom Brady, and as it's shaken out so far, most of their high-end talent has been taken. So, the Bucs decide to trade back into the top of the 2nd round, while giving up their pick to the Bears. The Bucs will get a future 2nd, as well as two 4th round picks. This gives them ample draft capital without giving up much, and puts them in an opportunity to regress further and find themselves falling into Caleb Williams or Drake Maye next year.</p>
<p>For Chicago, they pair their bright young QB with an elite option in JSN, not to mention the duo played with each other at Ohio State. After a few WR’s began to slide, this scenario sees Chicago moving up to secure Justin Fields’ guy, and the best receiver remaining in the draft. Njigba brings a serious boost to this offense, with great route running and explosion from the slot. He will instantly be a top threat for Fields and open up the rest of the field for new additions Chase Claypool and Darnell Mooney.</p>
<h2>Pick #20: Seattle selects O’Cyrus Torrence, G, Florida</h2>
<p>Veteran guard Mike Iupati retired at the end of last season, creating a void for the Seahawks to fill. Torrence is a massive, 6’5, 347 lb. guard who has never given up a sack in his four years starting in the NCAA. He is a mauler who shows his dominance in the run game, abusing whoever’s in front of him. Ken Walker is licking his lips thinking about running behind this beast, and for good reason. Torrence is a generational prospect at guard, and with great technique and feet, he will look to be a staple in the Seattle offensive line alongside last year’s first round pick Charles Cross.</p>
<h2>Pick #21: LA Chargers select Anton Harrison, OT, Oklahoma</h2>
<p>The Chargers need someone consistent playing opposite of Rashawn Slater, and Harrison displayed impressive pass protection skills playing at Oklahoma.</p>
<h2>Pick #22: Baltimore selects Nolan Smith, EDGE, Georgia</h2>
<p>Baltimore goes with the best edge rusher on the board here. Smith will be a quality starter fairly quickly for the Ravens and continues to build their army of pass rushers.</p>
<h2>Pick #23: Minnesota selects Drew Sanders, LB, Arkansas</h2>
<p>Brian Flores loves to blitz, and taking Drew Sanders here gives the Vikings a great, versatile piece in the middle of their defense who can do it all, including rush the passer.</p>
<h2>Pick #24: Jacksonville selects Deonte Banks, DB, Maryland</h2>
<p>Jacksonville needs to bolster their secondary, and Banks looks to be a great replacement for Shaquille Griffin, who likely won’t be returning to the team this year.</p>
<h2>Pick #25: NY Giants select Michael Mayer, TE, Notre Dame</h2>
<p>Brian Daboll gets a player in Mayer who could be a perennial Pro-Bowler at his position. Mayer makes plays in the receiving game with ease along with being the best blocking tight end in this class, and is a great piece for a rebuilding offense.</p>
<h2>Pick #26: Dallas selects Lukas Van Ness</h2>
<p>Dallas takes the young, bursting-with-potential Van Ness here late in the draft. This is a best-player-available situation, but Dallas could benefit from adding a power edge rusher with Demarcus Lawrence getting older every day.</p>
<h2>Pick #27: Buffalo selects John Michael Schmitz</h2>
<p>Buffalo needs to improve their interior run blocking, and there’s no better center prospect in this draft than Schmitz. He’s an elite run blocker who could potentially elevate the Bills running prowess.</p>
<h2>Pick #28: Cincinnati selects Dawand Jones, OT, Ohio State</h2>
<p>Despite investing in their offensive line last year, the Bengals still need to improve drastically. Jones looks like an industrial fridge lined up at tackle, and if he can refine his game, he could be a crucial addition to the newly anointed contenders.</p>
<h2>Pick #29: New Orleans selects Brian Branch</h2>
<p>Branch is an excellent player who slid due to his positional value in this case, but make no mistake: he is an incredible football player whose IQ makes everyone around him better, and New Orleans will appreciate his presence.</p>
<h2>Pick #30: Philadelphia selects Bijan Robinson, RB, Texas</h2>
<p>If the Eagles can’t re-sign Miles Sanders to a friendly deal, Robinson seems like a no brainer here. Adding a generational RB to the most dominant rushing attack in the league over the last two years? Sign me up.</p>
<h2>Pick #31: Kansas City selects Dalton Kincaid, TE, Utah</h2>
<p>Kansas City closes the first round by selecting the heir apparent to the Travis Kelce throne. Andy Reid is not afraid to use multiple tight ends all season long, and Kincaid looks eerily similar to Kelce while running his routes, and looks to be a highly productive piece of the Chiefs offensive in the future.</p>
