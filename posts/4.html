<p>The Denver Broncos, entering the 2022 season, were one of the most hyped-up teams in the league. Riding the disappointing tail end of a 2021 season in which they went 7-10, losing their last 4 games of the year and opening the exit doorway for head coach Vic Fangio, this was supposed to be the year that things finally changed for the better. Denver went 1-5 in games decided by one score during Fangio’s mediocre final year, all on the back of uninspired play from quarterback Teddy Bridgewater and reinforcement from a quality defense. If they had been able to pull through all of those close games, these Broncos would be living in a different universe. They were a handful of decisions away from being a 12-5 team, a team that would have been in the driver’s seat of an AFC West that was dominated by Pat Mahomes and bolstered by the new addition of Justin Herbert. It shows that they were right on the brink of breaking through into playoff contention, and that the makeup of their team needed to be altered. But, the issues that they faced didn’t seem as though they were structural. It was not for a lack of talent on the roster that the Denver Broncos were unable to win those close games. The Bronco’s lack of success undoubtedly was the result of inadequacy from both their head coach and their quarterback.</p>
<p>To be charitable to Fangio, he never really had a reliable player under center to support his dreams. The Broncos never saw a record above .500 under Fangio’s three seasons as coach, and he trotted out many different starting quarterbacks, a few among them being players like Joe Flacco, Drew Lock, Teddy Bridgewater, Brett Rypien, or my personal favorite, wide receiver turned emergency starting QB Kendall Hinton. It’s safe to say that Fangio was given the short end of the stick on offense, and that was entirely exacerbated by years of terrible luck with injuries on their roster. Several key players in all phases of the game suffered major injuries during the Fangio years, whether it be young talent like Jerry Jeudy missing extensive time in each of his seasons thus far, or players like superstar edge rusher Bradley Chubb going on IR during Fangio’s inaugural season in Denver. It only made sense that with such a marginal difference between AFC West supremacy and bottom feeding, that the people making the important decisions get shaken up. Fangio got a bad deal, but ultimately, 3 straight losing seasons is a bad way to maintain job security, and the Broncos’ faithful were fed up with mediocrity.</p>
<p>Both on the field and within the coaching staff, the people calling the shots for the organization were a problem that needed to be addressed. Years of failing to break through the competitive barrier is not a symptom of a broken roster, but of broken execution. Inconsistent quarterback play was always a painfully glaring issue, and it seemed as if the same story ended up writing itself during each of these Fangio years: a tough team with a hungry defense that proved itself to be scrappy, but ultimately one that also was run by an offense who would shoot itself in the foot when it needed to perform the most. This newly realized need for change came at just the right time, alongside a new ownership group. Rob Walton, heir to the Walmart empire and billionaire capitalist, purchased the Broncos before the 2022 season started. Knowing that they would be backed by an owner who had a big bankroll and a desire to win, they set out early to fix the problems that had plagued them for so long, to find a coach and quarterback duo competent enough to lift them up from inconsistency into title contention.</p>
<p>The 2022 offseason brought a slew of very promising names into the head coaching pool, and even more specifically, names who carried a lot of weight on the offensive side of the ball. Brian Daboll, the offensive coordinator behind Josh Allen’s incredible transformation from a raw talent to an MVP candidate, or Mike McDaniel, an enormous influence on the 49ers run scheme and a large part of their domination on the ground in recent years. Coaches like these were exactly what the Broncos were looking for; after seeing stagnation under a defensive-minded head coach like Fangio, the front office knew they needed to approach their hiring from a different perspective, and this large pool of offensive gurus was a perfect and unique opportunity for them to take their time and look at their options during hiring.</p>
<p>While Denver was unable to lure either of those names to coach for them, they still were able to make a hire that, at the time, seemed like a perfect fit for the Broncos. The 2022 calendar year was kicked off with GM George Paton signing Packers offensive coordinator Nathaniel Hackett, another one of the plethora of offensive minds that hit the market in 2022. Hackett received heaps of praise from back-to-back MVP Aaron Rodgers during his time with the Packers on his ability as a leader and as someone who could garner respect from his players. The son of a former NFL coach, Hackett has a great football mind, and, as Rodgers’ future was seemingly up in the air with the Packers, the arrival of Hackett seemed to come at a very convenient time.</p>
<p>I believe that in a perfect world, Paton would’ve been able to pull off a miracle and get Rodgers to Denver, however he had to. The coach and quarterback duo was all that Broncos faithful could talk about during the offseason, and there was palpable buzz surrounding the pair having a reunion at Mile High. Supposedly, there were never really any trade talks involving Rodgers; I’m not buying it. I’m not sure what really went down, but one can speculate. Perhaps the Broncos weren’t coming with enough firepower for the Packers to even consider making a move. Perhaps the Packers were asking for a haul so ridiculous that the Broncos hung up the phone. Or, perhaps there was a deal in place, pending Rodgers approval, and he took a look at the situation in Denver and saw something he didn’t like? It’s likely that no one will ever know the entire truth behind this “what if'' scenario, because Rodgers never ended up leaving Green Bay, and the Broncos were forced to settle for plan B.</p>
<p>Two months after the Hackett hiring, and their pursuit for Rodgers proving to be unsuccessful, the Broncos made arguably the biggest splash move of free agency and one of the most significant trades the league had seen in some time. The front office proved they were willing to take drastic action to improve the areas they felt they were struggling in, and sent two 1st round picks, two 2nd round picks, tight end Noah Fant, DT Shelby Harris, and QB Drew Lock to the Seattle Seahawks in exchange for Super Bowl-winning signal caller Russell Wilson. The trade was seen as a massive victory for Denver at a time when they desperately needed it. The fans had been clamoring for moves like this for years up to this point. The quarterback position was never able to provide the team with stability or security, so they spent as many picks as they needed to fix it. The head coach was seemingly never able to foster a winning culture, so they opened up the bankroll for someone who had lost only six games in the previous two years, and a coach who helped Aaron Rodgers rekindle his MVP fire, someone who was thought to be a proven winner.</p>
<p>Sure, he never had any real head coaching experience, but they had everything they needed to succeed! All they needed was to fix these two major points of emphasis, and they did exactly that, in overwhelming fashion. The Broncos, in a little over four months during the offseason, transformed themselves from a middling organization into a playoff contender at a time that it felt absolutely essential to do so. The Chargers spent all offseason building a defense of superstars, signing J.C Jackson and trading for Khalil Mack. The Raiders reunited their franchise QB Derek Carr with his college teammate and future Hall of Famer Devante Adams. It seemed that all at once, the alarm bells were ringing in the AFC West, and the message was clear: teams are gearing up for an arms race, and you have to either keep up or step off. The Broncos finally took action and put themselves in a position to succeed amongst their peers - so why didn’t it work?</p>
<p>Why did the Broncos proceed to have one the most disappointing seasons in NFL history after all this hype? How could a team on the brink of breaking through the barriers of mediocrity, who finally took the steps to address the problems that had been plaguing their franchise for years, peter out so miserably? It turns out that things aren’t as black and white as you might think they are, sort of like most things in life.</p>
<p>The Denver Broncos’ 2022 season was a season from hell. The hopes of the team coming into their new identity with their new leadership vanished almost as quickly as they had come together. It became very clear early on that Hackett was in miles over his own head, and was completely unqualified to be the head coach. From the very first game, he showed glaring issues in his game and clock management skills: he made the decision to attempt the second longest field goal in NFL history (64 yards), after completely botching the final minute of clock time, a minute that saw the Broncos refuse to use any of their three timeouts, and refusing to try and go for a first down on a 4th and 5 play that would’ve put kicker Brandon McManus in a much better position to win the game. Instead, they sat right where they were, and the world saw Hackett’s brain scramble in real time, taking a brutal loss to open the season as McManus came up just short. The worst part about it: the game was Russell Wilson’s homecoming game, and they lost by 1 point to the Seahawks, whom they just made the blockbuster deal with.</p>
<p>Moments like this became a part of the experience for the Broncos under Hackett. This Seahawks disaster was very emblematic of the trends the Broncos experienced throughout the season, and the outcome should have been a symbol of what was to follow them. Hackett’s offense frequently became victim to discombobulation leading to abhorrent delay-of-game penalties. Against Seattle, this happened twice, including an unacceptable delay call on a 2nd and goal at the 1 yard line. It was painfully obvious that Denver didn’t have the capability to convert in the most important situations in the game, repeatedly failing to get in the endzone inside 20 yards and repeatedly failing to earn first downs in third and short situations, largely due to terrible play calling. All of this happened all season long, and week one was just a sneak peek. Hackett was grossly unprepared to run this team, and is largely at fault for the massive flop the Broncos produced this year. He became only the 2nd coach in NFL history to be fired during his very first season, being canned after a 4-11 start.  His clock management skills were so abhorrent, he needed to hire a clock management coach during the season. A culture of winning and competence was nowhere in sight.</p>
<p>The defense looked great in week one, limiting the Seahawks to only 17 points, but again, it was immediately evident that Russ was not playing at an elite level. He struggled in a game that should have been a layup for the Broncos. The Seahawks were supposed to be one of the worst teams in football after moving on from Russell Wilson, and although they proved to be a lot tougher than most people thought, it was a disappointing result for a team that held big aspirations. Offseason speculation and rumors of discontent from Russ’s camp during his final years in Seattle left many people questioning the functionality of the Seahawks organization and wondering if Pete Carrol’s days as a head coach were numbered. Although Russ had an admittedly down year during his last stint in Seattle, that was simply chalked up to the decline of the Seahawks of the 2010’s. They were a far cry from the dominance they once exhibited with the legion of boom, and more recently struggled mightily on defense while Russ did everything he could to keep them treading above water.</p>
<p>But Wilson’s struggles were not limited to just opening weekend. His play was evident of a major regression from his former Pro Bowl self throughout most of his appearances during the year. His career in Seattle was defined by his ability to make plays out of structure, to see the field once the play broke down and make great decisions adlib. He had an impressive ability to muster just enough with his legs to move the chains without compromising his body. Some people argued that Russ held onto the ball a little too long in Seattle, manufacturing pressure for himself and taking more sacks than he needed. Others critiqued him for not being able to see the middle of the field, as he has historically neglected that section of the field during his career as a passer.</p>
<p>Watching Russell Wilson play in 2022, you saw a player completely fall away from their identity. It was watching a player who, at times, seemed to forget everything he knew about playing football. He rarely escaped the structure of the pocket to make plays. He rarely decided to use his legs, a skillset he possessed that helped him reach his potential MVP status at times in Seattle. It seemed as if Wilson and his receivers spent the year trying to build chemistry and get on the same page, rather than actually producing — an issue just as reflective of coaching as it is of Russ. Oftentimes balls would go flying toward the sidelines as his receiver cut infield, and vice versa.</p>
<p>However, it wasn’t only Russ’s play that sparked conversation during his first year as a Bronco — it was his off-the-field antics as well. He carried himself as if he was the main character in a sad comedy movie. He adopted the slogan “Broncos country, let’s ride!” when he arrived in Denver. He would dejectedly spout those words to conclude his press conferences after some absolutely brutal losses, losses where his poor play was the most glaring issue just 30 minutes previously. He himself told stories of taking practice, “mental” reps, in the aisle of the team plane as his teammates slept. He makes corny Tik-Toks. He demands his teammates on the sidelines yell out “Pass!” during a pass and “Ball!” when the ball is in the air.</p>
<p>You might read about his actions and think Russ is a cornball. You may think he seems like a good guy. I’m not here to convince you to think one way or the other. I think it’s undeniable, though, that Russell Wilson has to address the way he carries himself during the year. A litany of former Seahawks came out publicly and did everything but explicitly say Russ has a problem with his ego. Some of the most respected names from that legendary Seattle team, names like future Hall of Famer Richard Sherman, or even legendary head coach Pete Carrol, have talked about how, allegedly, he felt he deserved special treatment in the locker room, and would prioritize preserving his legacy and being an MVP over his team’s success and culture. People around him felt as if he was playing a character, making it hard for his peers in the locker room to take his leadership seriously. Stories like these corroborate the reports that came from Denver throughout the season, some of which indicated that Russell’s teammates had lost faith in him and that he was a divisive point inside the locker room.</p>
<p>To put it simply, he was straight up bad, and the antics didn’t help. In conjunction with the coaching malpractice from Hackett, Russ had the worst year of his career since 2016. He scored the fewest total touchdowns in any career in his season. The offense he ran was anemic throughout the entire year, scoring a historically low 16.9 PPG. To make it even worse for the Broncos, they fell victim to the injury bug all throughout the season. They were entering the new year excited to see their 2nd year running back from UNC, Javonte Williams, grow into a starting role over the struggling Melvin Gordon. Tim Patrick was a blossoming pass catcher who had one of the best catch rates in the league, someone who caught seemingly everything that came his way. Left tackle Garrett Bolles, a second team All-Pro in 2020 and a $68 million man, was looking to have a career year protecting Russ’s blindside. Starting center and 2nd year player Lloyd Cushenberry III had a promising 2021 season and was making strides to solidify himself as the glue to that offensive line unit. All of these players faced season-ending injuries that had a drastic effect on the success of Denver during 2022.</p>
<p>The optimism built up during last offseason can only be recognized now as a curse for all of Broncos nation. I would not wish your fate upon my worst enemy. To be told for years that you are so, so close, and then to seemingly address all of the issues holding you back, to be flushed with such hope and optimism… only to have perhaps the worst season in franchise history? It seems wrong. It seems evil. It’s a reminder to all football fans that the football gods show no mercy to any man; they will strike you down where you stand.</p>
<p>So how will the Denver Broncos correct the ship? How does this disaster find its silver lining? Is Russell Wilson a lost cause? Is there any hope for the Broncos faithful?</p>
<p>After the ugly departure of Hackett, it's safe to say that the Broncos have hit rock bottom. And, honestly, that’s a good thing. It’s encouraging to know as a fan of a team that it really can’t get much worse than this, despite being in such a bad spot. Fortunately, there’s nowhere to go but up from here. The level of desperation that was felt during this tumultuous year was perhaps captured most effectively by the move to trade edge rusher, Bradley Chubb. They sent him off to Miami in exchange for a first round pick, replacing the first round pick they dealt for Russ, replenishing a bit of their stockpile in hopes to make up for the major loss of draft capital they seemingly flushed down the toilet last offseason. A 5-12 football team is already a great reason to feel desperation, but with the picks they gave up, the Broncos were truly feeling the pain from the trade. Their first-round pick could have had them picking at fifth overall in this year's draft and put them in a position to take potentially monumental and generational talent within the top 5. Instead, they had to make up for lost time, and lose a crucial piece of their team because of it.</p>
<p>The direction they decided to go for their new head coach, however, should have fans hopeful that they can come back and see a night-and-day difference from the utter collapse that took place in 2022. Denver needed to hire someone who had a lot of experience, because it was very clear that one of the main drivers of its inadequacy had been just that. They also needed to hire someone who is comfortable with working with Russ, someone who has experience with working with aging quarterback talent, perhaps. Perhaps someone like… Sean Payton?</p>
<p>Since moving on from coach Hackett a little bit past the halfway point of the season, the Broncos found themselves unexpectedly stumbling into basically first dibs on whomever they desired to pursue to fill their newfound void at the position. And so, they got to work. From the moment it was legally allowed, the Broncos courted the future Hall of Fame coach and Super Bowl champion from his retirement in New Orleans. Payton remained under contract with the Saints, so Denver would be forced to compensate them if they were to make a deal for Payton, which they did.</p>
<p>The Broncos took a look at the field of coaches and zeroed in on Payton early, and for good reason. Make no mistake, there seemed to be some elite football minds in the pool of potential suitors, names like DeMeco Ryans, the young and charismatic defensive coordinator for the 49ers, or like Eric Bienemy and Dan Quinn, two names that come up every year in regards to the most desirable people to poach from their respective teams. Payton was undoubtedly the best fit for this Bronco’s unit, though, and it’s a lot deeper than just his overwhelming name value.</p>
<p>The only problem? They had to give up a 2023 first round pick (the pick gained from trading Bradley Chubb), and a 2024 second and third round selection as well. The Broncos were forced to give up some hefty, albeit worthwhile, draft capital, further digging themselves into a resource-bare hole and handicapping their ability to make any significant immediate moves for Payton to construct a winning roster. If there’s anyone that the Bronco’s faithful should trust with this overwhelming task, though, it’s Coach Payton, as his track record shows just how incredible he is.</p>
<p>The New Orleans Saints under Sean Payton developed from the laughing stock of the league into a competent and competitive organization with a winning culture. Since he took over in 2006, the Saints barely even sniffed a sub .500 record, while never having a losing season worse than 7-9, and having this same record in three straight seasons from 2014-2016. Think of this small blip of mediocrity as the intermission period for Payton. During these years, coming to the end of his first era of success, he pulled from his experience in roster creation and maintenance to give his career as the Saints head coach a second wind.</p>
<p>That flame from his Super Bowl success had to burn out eventually, and ownership allowed him to retool and reload the roster, during those years riding with the middle of the pack. After 2016, he never lost more than 5 games in a season. He led the Saints to the playoffs 9 times in his 15 years in New Orleans, and in 2018 was one incredibly controversial play away from facing the Patriots in the Super Bowl. He evolved his offense to accommodate an aging and often injured Drew Brees during the final years of his career, constructing an offensive infrastructure that made it as easy as possible for Brees to still use his brain to run a high-powered offense. Three conference championship appearances, one Super Bowl, and five seasons with 12+ wins, including four 13 win seasons is nothing to scoff at, and it’s clear that Payton has every bit of qualification for the job.</p>
<p>One of the most fitting parts of this new marriage is Payton’s fit with, and even leverage over, Russell Wilson. He’s coming into a situation on the field similar to what he faced in the waning years of his time in New Orleans; Just as Drew Brees’ play declined as he got older, it seems Wilson’s is as well. Whether it’s due to an overinflated ego, or simply aging and injuries, his efficiency with the ball, as well as his ability to read the field, seems to have taken a hit. Payton has proven that he has the knowledge to maximize the output of whoever is under center. And if he can’t salvage his play into something that represents winning football, he can move on from Russ and choose to form his offense the way he’d like to.</p>
<p>It’s arguable just how much Sean Payton helped Brees turn into one of the best quarterbacks ever, but it would be wrong to say he didn’t have at least a palpable impact on his trajectory. Brees was in an air raid-style offense in San Diego, and it didn’t pair well with his skillset. Payton took who he thought was a player with immense potential and put him into a system that maximized the tools he had. He veered towards a West Coast-style offense, with quick, short, and intermediate throws that gave playmakers the ability to rack up yards in open space. This upgraded Brees from a solid quarterback with questions surrounding his name into an open-and-shut first-ballot Hall of Famer, as his decision-making and quick trigger coupled with Payton’s revamped offense led to one of the winningest QB-HC duos in league history.</p>
<p>Drew Brees was unquestionably a great player on his own, but Payton made him a record breaker. Before the 2022 season, he held records for both the most passing yards in a season (5,476) and the most passing yards in a career (80,358), broken by Pat Mahomes and Tom Brady respectively. I would like to make it clear that I don’t believe Sean Payton can turn Russell Wilson into a record breaker. I think Russ has shown a significant enough decline to warrant legitimate concern about his future play, and he’s going to have a very tight leash, even with his lucrative contract. But, I do think Russ has enough talent in the tank that he can salvage what he has left, and the Broncos absolutely could not have gotten a better person to take on that task.</p>
<p>Payton will need to rework the offense in a major way if he wants to see any positive production. And he’ll also have to challenge Russ in ways he has never been challenged before in his career. Wilson has gotten used to marauding around with a group of personal specialists and advisors, known as “Team 3”. During his introductory press conference, he was asked about Wilson’s team having access to the team’s facility, and his response was telling, saying, “That’s foreign to me… That's not going to take place here. I'm not familiar with it, but our staff will be here. Our players will be here.” Russ allegedly routinely received treatment from his personal performance team with things like massages or physical therapy sessions, for him and funded by him. He allegedly received his own office space in the team building, a luxury no other player has.</p>
<p>Things like these divide a locker room. It sets an arrogant and isolating tone, suggesting that Russ is far more important and thus deserving of preferential treatment. It’s arguable that he is far more important, simply because of the position he plays, but anyone who knows football cannot justify that behavior with that logic. No one is above the team, no matter what position you are, and these types of instances, whether he feels justified acting this way or not, show the people you are supposed to be leading that you don’t feel they’re equal to you. Coincidentally, his “rah-rah” antics have ramped up a significant amount during his time in Colorado. One would assume that someone who spends so much time talking about and trying to cultivate positivity breeds those same feelings in his peers, but in the context of all of the nonsense surrounding Russ, it comes off as disingenuous, almost as if it’s for show.</p>
<p>Sean Payton definitely has his work cut out for him in Denver, whether it be dealing with the lack of resources and draft capital at his disposal, or in dealing with tackling the Russ problem. He also faces the underrated challenge of building his new coaching staff. Elijah Evero, the talented young defensive coordinator the Broncos had in 2022, was just poached by the Carolina Panthers and Frank Reich. A good coaching staff is monumental in rebuilding a winning environment for the team, and it will be interesting to see the direction that Payton goes with these hirings.</p>
<p>Even with all of this uncertainty, one thing is clear. The Denver Broncos are a couple of major changes away from becoming a competent, dare I say, competitive, football team. The defense has clearly never been the problem, and even in 2022, they only let up 21.1 PPG, despite outlier games towards the end of the season, like letting up 51 against the Rams. They played out of their minds, and their numbers slowly worsened, since they spent so much time on the field due to their poor offense. Through week 15, they had only let up 17 PPG. Despite all of the drama and misery, the Broncos still found themselves in positions to fight. They became the only team in NFL history to lose 10(!) one-score games in the same season. You read that right. The Denver Broncos were one score away from winning a game in 10 separate instances in 2022, and did not win any of them.</p>
<p>This is evidence of a roster on the brink. The Broncos have the infrastructure they need to rebound from their terrible season and bounce back into success, despite the dismal results they reaped last year. Broncos fans have been here before, though. In fact, they were in this same spot last year at this time, being fed the same lines, that they were almost there, that they were a couple pieces away. This time should feel different, though. Now, you know what you’re getting into. You’ve seen it get as bad as it can possibly get: a first-year head coach being fired, and all of your assets being traded, assets that would have been better used in a garbage disposal than the results they got this year. You’ve seen the rumor mill constantly tarnish your franchise’s brand-new, expensive quarterback, and you’ve seen him disappoint time and time again on the field.</p>
<p>Now, however, they are giving the reins to Sean Payton, and with one of the most lucrative coaching contracts ever doled out — one rumored to be slightly north of $20 million — the team has invested the capital that suggests he is in total control. With all of the tools he needs, it’s now up to coach Payton to produce results. He’s been given an open canvas, and if he is as masterful of an artist as his track record and his reputation suggest, he could potentially paint a masterpiece in Denver.</p>
