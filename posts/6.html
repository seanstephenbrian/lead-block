<p>…and he hasn’t even taken a snap on the field yet. On Wednesday, March 1st, it was made public that an arrest warrant had been issued for Jalen Carter on misdemeanor charges of reckless driving and racing. The January 2023 incident was a tragedy, resulting in the deaths of Georgia staffer, Chandler LeCroy, and redshirt sophomore, Devon Willock, after the vehicle they were in crashed into a power pole at over 100 mph.</p>
<p>Toxicology showed that LeCroy, who was driving the vehicle, was intoxicated at the time of the crash. The Athens-Clarke police department stated that Jalen Carter was racing his Jeep Grand Cherokee alongside LeCroy. Carter was sentenced to 12 months of probation, a $1,000 fine, and 50 hours of community service.</p>
<p>After acknowledging the sadness and magnitude of this incident, it’s also abundantly clear that this will have massive implications for the decisions that will be made on draft night. This news affects a large swath of teams picking inside the top 15, and I would argue, is another complicated part in a larger moment that will be pivotal to NFL history. Shaking up the composition of this draft, a draft in which multiple teams could see themselves trade into the top 5 in an attempt to secure their future at QB, will drastically alter the course of the destiny of several teams at critical points in their franchise’s history. Just a few days ago, the Bears dealt the 1st overall pick in the draft and received a massive haul from the Panthers that included heavy draft compensation, and, crucially, elite young WR D.J Moore.</p>
<p>Whether the trade had anything to do with the Carter news is up for personal speculation, but at the very least, the trade that ended up happening between Carolina and Chicago is a far cry from what the media had mocked as chalk up until a week before it was made. The Colts and Texans were in a battle to move up and claim the rights to the QB of their choosing, thanks to a crazy ending to the Texan’s season, an ending that saw a mind-blowing final sequence. Lovie Smith gave one final grand gesture to his beloved Bears, a team he had brought to the Super Bowl in 2006. Houston won on a 4th and 20 hail Mary followed up by an additional 2-point conversion to take the lead over the Colts, during the final minute of regulation both teams would play all season.</p>
<p>This chaotic win was surely a pyrrhic victory for the Texans, as it eliminated them from their ownership of the first overall selection, a right they had held throughout almost the entire season. That miraculous play essentially was the catalyst for the Texans to relinquish the agency that they’d given themselves regarding their ability to choose a quarterback that they’re absolutely sure of, before anyone else has the opportunity to perhaps take said player. There had been rumblings for weeks of a potential Bears-Texans deal prior to the Panthers making the move, but, to me, those rumors become even more likely now that the pick has found itself in Carolina’s hands.</p>
<p>The Panthers first appeared to be in love with C.J Stroud, from Ohio State, as opposed to the previously favored QB1 Bryce Young from Alabama. As we get closer and closer to draft night, however, the betting odds have shifted back towards Young to be selected 1st overall. Both have shown an incredible ability to play quarterback and both project to be outstanding professionals in the NFL for their various and unique traits and skillsets. Both have also shown weaknesses that could be causes of concern for NFL offenses today.</p>
<p>C.J Stroud was largely viewed as QB2 during most of the season, only to creep into consideration for the best in his class after a gutsy and incredible performance during the college football playoff against the best defense in the country in Georgia. NFL analysts and scouts ragged on him throughout the season for a lack of mobility, and less skill at creating outside of the structure of a play if it were to break down.</p>
<p>His offense at Ohio State was so well schemed and so talented that he often was throwing to his first or second read, and some people argue that the lack of experience in having to improvise should a play extend longer than he might like will harm his play at the next level. Personally, I have no doubt that Stroud will become a quality starting QB in the NFL for a long time during his career. He’s got every tool he needs to be successful and he has a knack for making absolutely incredible and difficult throws look effortless. With the right pieces surrounding him, he’s shown elite ball placement and accuracy and looks highly capable of making decisions in a structured offense.</p>
<p>Bryce Young was absolutely outstanding during his time commanding the huddle for Alabama. He arrived at campus having already proved himself as a promising player, as he was a consensus 5 star prospect and put up record breaking numbers during his time in high school at revered high school football factory Mater Dei. At Alabama he was even more impressive. He won the Heisman in his first year as a starter after backing up Mac Jones, and has proven to be the most naturally talented QB that has ever come through Alabama.</p>
<p>While he doesn’t have eye-popping arm strength or insane athleticism that some other top QBs have had in years past, he makes up for it with his unique arm elasticity and playmaking abilities. It seems there is not an arm angle conceivable that Young would have difficulty making accurate, high velocity throws from, and this gift allows for some unbelievable highlights which see him side-arming and flicking the ball all over the field like it’s just another day at the office. A magician in the pocket, he'll have no problem adjusting to modern day offenses.</p>
<p>Young would be the undisputed option for the first overall selection if it weren’t for one problem: his size. There are serious concerns about whether the barely 5’10”, 204 lb. QB will be able to sustain NFL play with such a small frame. Regardless of how you feel about either of these players, one reality is clear: there is a vast discrepancy between the evaluation of these two prospects on a team-by-team basis. It’s not a crazy idea to think that some teams could shy away from Young because of his size, even though he has produced and played at such an incredibly high level at all points in his career. The NFL is a business, and if a front office has legitimate concerns about the durability of a player they’re viewing as potentially worthy of the 1st overall selection, it makes sense for them to look in a different direction.</p>
<p>So what does all of this have to do with the developing story of Jalen Carter? Why would QB1 in the draft come down to a defensive line prospect? As it turns out, it has a lot to do with leverage and desperation, and will have implications on the league that are felt far beyond just the 2023 season.</p>
<p>By making a deal for the 1st overall pick, the Panthers not only bet the farm on whoever they deem talented enough for the selection, but they also drastically altered the course of the top 15 picks of this draft and arguably the future of multiple rebuilding teams. Moving from pick #9 all the way to the 1st spot means the Panthers had to give up a lot to get there, and all the capital they gave up means the future of this franchise will live or die with whatever decision the front office makes this year. Chicago has braved its way through one of the most significant offseason periods that they’ve ever taken on in their franchise’s illustrious history, and as they continue to pile up assets, it looks more and more likely that they will have a competitive roster for years to come.</p>
<p>Chicago and Carolina are not the only teams that have had their future altered by this butterfly effect. Prior to Jalen Carter falling out of top 4 contention, it was looking likely that the draft was on its way to shaping up much differently. Up until the Carolina trade, it was speculated that the Bears would prefer to move down to pick 2 through pick 4. Both Will Anderson Jr. and Carter were penned in as blue-chip prospects that you absolutely could not miss under any circumstance, and trying to ensure one of those two players join their roster was something the Bears should have been very keen on.</p>
<p>Whether the Jalen Carter story had any impact on the decision to make the trade with the Panthers is unclear. But, something must have happened in their evaluation of him. To me, it makes sense to think that Bears GM Ryan Poles looked deeper into this year’s draft and even next year’s class, and concluded that he could wait a little bit to snag some players he likes later on or from the 2024 crop.</p>
<p>Because of this, Poles had the wiggle room to make a bet that he could get quality prospects at positions his team needs to improve at with his new haul of picks. He figured that the talent available to him at 9 and with the additional capital he accrued would be sufficiently able to fill their needs. This confidence in his capital is largely a product of his own decisions as well. By dishing the 1st overall pick to Carolina, a team that was not previously in any sort of position to guarantee themselves a QB at 9, Poles stoked a fire for the remaining QB-desperate teams in hopes he could catch them scrambling over themselves and reap the benefits.</p>
<p>The Texans no longer have the ability to guarantee themselves their top choice, and will now have to defer to the Panthers, hoping they don’t pick the player they had in mind. The Colts are now staring down the barrel of one of the worst-case scenarios facing them in this draft; with two quarterbacks going in the first two selections practically being a guarantee, there is a mounting pressure for their desperate front office to figure out what they’re going to do at the position, and an increasingly smaller supply. They also face the threat of an increased demand for 3rd overall, and there are already rumors swirling that a handful of teams are interested in trading for that pick.</p>
<p>Teams like the Titans at 11, the Falcons at 8, the Raiders at 7, or even the Seahawks at 5 are all teams that have needs at QB or are openly discussing planning for their future. This leaves Indianapolis in a position where if they want to get the player they still like, it’s going to cost them much more to move up than it would have in a world without the Panthers at 1.</p>
<p>There is a very real world where the Colts miss out on all of the QBs they want if they stay at 4, or even end up taking the last player available out of the top 4, regardless how they feel about them, out of desperation for an answer at QB. Indianapolis very quickly turned from a position where they felt confident that, at the very least, they could get one of the players they prefer, to a position where they are likely going to be the odd one out of the bunch.</p>
<p>If this plays out, though, it won’t just be the QB needy teams that will feel the effects. The whole league will feel the ripples from this year’s offseason, in both conferences, for years to come. If there are 4 QBs taken in the first 4 selections, the rest of the talent will inevitably see a slide, some larger than others.</p>
<p>The Seahawks staying at 5th overall would benefit more than anyone else because of this process. Seattle is coming off of a 2022 draft that absolutely knocked it out of the park on almost all fronts. It’s looking like they hit on multiple different positions and secured an important chunk of their young core with players like Charles Cross, Ken Walker II, Boye Mafe, and Tariq Woolen. In addition to already quality cast of players on their roster, like DK Metcalf, Tyler Lockett, Uchenna Nwosu, and Jordyn Brooks, they are unexpectedly stumbling upon a Super Bowl window that has been greatly accelerated, largely due to the already incredible production and potential room for growth from their 2022 class. A player like Will Anderson Jr. would give the Seahawks a dominant edge rusher and add yet another piece to the Lombardi trophy puzzle they are building.</p>
<p>Philadelphia sits at 10th overall and it’s not entirely unlikely that they could benefit from this domino effect as well. Coming off of a Super Bowl appearance, they have an opportunity to add even more premier talent to an already loaded roster. If the high-end defensive talent like Jalen Carter or Tyree Wilson happen to fall into their laps, it would be a no brainer for them as they need to supplant the loss of elite DT Javon Hargrave to the 49ers. Additionally, 10th overall becomes that much more enticing to move on from if you know you can grab one of your guys a little bit later on in the round and additionally add extra value with newly acquired future picks. Howie Roseman is one of the best general managers to grace the modern NFL, so if there’s anyone I believe in to make a move like that, it would be him.</p>
<p>NFL draft season is one of the most ridiculous times in all of sports media. There are endless possibilities for every team and an endless range of outcomes for what might truly shake up. Ludicrous speculation almost always seeps its way into the real conversations happening around the league, and players’ stock rises and falls because of it. It’s not entirely clear if the Carter news spurred Chicago to make their decisions, but the Bears actions surely changed the destinies of many of their NFL peers for better or for worse.</p>
<p>Houston no longer has total control of their future. If they take the wrong QB, it will likely result in more proverbial heads rolling and another decade of miserable football for the Texans. They have additional pressure to get it right, as both the Colts and the Titans have publicly expressed interest in this year’s quarterback class.</p>
<p>The Cardinals fall into a position where they have the opportunity to receive a massive haul to move out of their 3rd overall spot, and kickstart their rebuild in the best way possible. They hold a substantial amount of leverage now and will be the difference in at least one team walking away from this offseason process without upgrading at QB despite it being such a pressing need for them.</p>
<p>Indianapolis has suffered arguably more than any other team mentioned, but not all is lost. Having had 6(!) starting QBs since the abrupt retirement of Andrew Luck, the Colts have by no means had it easy. They’ve been put into a position where, yet again, they’re on the outside looking in to try to find a meaningful upgrade at the position. That is, if they are looking towards the draft.</p>
<p>The Colts uniquely find themselves with an opportunity to explore the idea of Lamar Jackson under center, ever since the public acknowledgement of his March 2nd trade request. It would take an extensive amount of capital to accomplish, but Jackson would undoubtedly solve a problem that the Colts have been desperately trying to fix since 2019. Either way, the path to getting better for Indi looks a bit steeper than it did just a month ago. They have to wrestle with choosing between staying put at 4th, and risk being jumped by their division rival Tennessee (which would be an absolute disaster), or moving on to the uncertainty of pursuing Lamar Jackson, or even a QB from the 2024 class. Both of these options, as they stand, have not come close to answering the Colts’ prayers for a quarterback, but time will tell how it shakes out.</p>
<p>Seattle finds themselves to be the luckiest of the bunch when it’s all said and done. They’ll be able to get better for their immediate future if they pick any of the top defensive prospects, as well as continue building onto an elite young core in hopes to fulfill Super Bowl aspirations for this decade. A generational prospect like Will Anderson Jr. or Jalen Carter would be astronomical for the development of the Seahawks’ defense and they are almost guaranteed a crack at one of them at the very least.</p>
<p>The Lions, Raiders, and Falcons could all very well be searching for a QB, and at 6th, 7th, and 8th, respectively, they are very much in contention to move up for someone if they believe they can be a franchise player.</p>
<p>Pretty much any one of the teams coming after the Colts have an incentive to move ahead of them. And some of them, like the Raiders and Falcons, have new management who may feel as though they need to make a move to answer their questions at quarterback. The Raiders have a brand-new GM, Dave Ziegler, who could be eager to use his capital to trade up for a QB he loves and lock down an essential part of the rebuild right away. The Falcons GM, Terry Fontenot, received uninspiring play from rookie Desmond Ridder, and coming up on his second year as a young GM, will be in the same boat as Ziegler. The lifespan of an NFL GM is a short one, and that’s especially the case if they can’t find stability and success at QB.</p>
<p>Chicago, now finding themselves at 9, can confidently be considered the winners of the draft even before they’ve made any selection. Ryan Poles is writing a Harvard course on how to conduct yourself as the GM of a rebuilding team. He put his faith in his young quarterback and put out a roster that was bad enough to garner the 1st overall pick (with a little bit of luck), and simultaneously put out an entertaining product for the team’s struggling fanbase.</p>
<p>He doubled down on the electric talent of Justin Fields and did it in a way that benefited the Bears far greater than he could have ever dreamed of if he had stayed put and made a selection at that pick. He found a way to manufacture pressure for other teams who feel desperate for a quarterback and at the same time made sure to not trade so far back that they won’t be able to catch a falling star in case they see one. If you were to tell me, about 3 months ago, that there is a real chance that the Chicago Bears could trade from 1st overall to 9th overall, and still have a chance at drafting Jalen Carter, I would have thought you were crazy. However, as the draft comes ever closer, that reality is becoming more likely day by day.</p>
<p>Philadelphia sits at 10th overall and it’s not entirely unlikely that they could benefit from this domino effect as well. Coming off of a Super Bowl appearance, they have an opportunity to add even more premier talent to an already loaded roster. If the high-end defensive talent like Jalen Carter or Tyree Wilson happen to fall into their laps, it would be a no brainer for them as they need to supplant the loss of elite DT Javon Hargrave to the 49ers. Additionally, 10th overall becomes that much more enticing to move on from if you know you can grab one of your guys a little bit later on in the round and add extra value with newly acquired future picks in the process.</p>
<p>Howie Roseman is one of the best general managers to grace the modern NFL, so if there’s anyone I believe in to make a move like that, it would be him. It would not surprise me at all if the Eagles moved back from 10th into the back half of the first round if they felt they could secure talent at a position they may need to address a couple of years down the line. Roseman is the type of GM that won’t hesitate to select a player at a position he foresees to be vacant in a year or two’s time (like DB or OT), and there will surely be suitors should they decide to move in this direction.</p>
<p>Just a brief look at the teams picking in the top ten shows that there could be monumental implications on the future of the league depending on what happens in the first 5 picks. The lack of assurance surrounding Jalen Carter’s name leading up to the draft will be the key factor in how the dominos will fall. There are desperate front offices all around the league who are hanging on by a thread, trying to do whatever they can to hold on to their jobs and keep heads from rolling. Acting out of desperation in the draft, more often than not, leaves a franchise and a front office regretful and in a worse place than they started.</p>
<p>The 2023 NFL draft will go down in history as one of the most important drafts in the history of the sport post-2000. Game-changing prospects on both the offensive and defensive sides of the ball add a sprinkle of chaos into an already dynamic draft environment that holds as much uncertainty as any in recent memory. However these next few weeks play out, there will be fans across the league holding their breath as their favorite team looks long and hard at a fork in their path.</p>
