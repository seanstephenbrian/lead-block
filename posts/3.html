    The Carolina Panthers face one of the most uncertain futures in the NFL. The glory days of the Ron Rivera administration are long gone, and the team is still trying to claw its way back into the mix in the NFC South, let alone become a prominent player in the NFC playoff picture. The Panthers have been held back by poor quarterback play for some time now, ever since Cam Newton regressed into a shell of his former self due to injuries and misutilization. It seems as though the team has been simmering in mediocrity ever since, resulting in some downright sad results for a truly passionate football fanbase that is hungry for playoff success. Following a wildcard round exit in 2017, they started off the year hot, looking to grasp onto some of the magic that carried them into such surprising playoff prominence in years previous. They won 6 of their first 8 games in 2018, with former league MVP Cam Newton leading his team to a 6-2 record while at the helm going into the trade deadline. The Panthers proceeded to fold like a lawn chair, dropping 7 straight before a win against the Saints came in week 17 to stop the bleeding. For Panthers fans, the pain just got worse, as three straight 5 win seasons, littered with underperformances and unfortunate injury luck went onto befall the team after the disappointment of 2018. I would like to call these seasons “The Lost Years”, because it seems as if the team has been wandering aimlessly, latching onto the false hope that had been generated by the huge investments that new owner David Tepper and the front office had made into now former head coach Matt Rhule and Former New York Jets QB Sam Darnold.

    That statement seems ridiculous in retrospect, as both Darnold and Rhule respectively contributed only negatively to the state the Panthers find themselves in today, and were a massive failure in terms of the assets invested into each project and the outcome they each garnished. Matt Rhule was fired after an embarrassing 22 point loss to the 49ers to land the Panthers at 1-4 through 5 weeks. Tepper, who bought the team in 2018, unloaded a massive amount of money to lure Rhule away from his program at Baylor, where he was seeing major success. The contract was signed for Rhule to be the head coach, listed at a whopping $62 million, 7 year, fully guaranteed deal. Tepper made Rhule one of the ten highest paid coaches in the league immediately, and locked himself into a deal with a head coach who did not have one lick of NFL experience, and whose rise to prominence included flipping the programs of the universities of Temple and Baylor, respectively. Riding the high of these successes, Tepper gave him the lucrative 7-year contract, and thus, cemented the beginning of his legacy as the new owner of the Panthers as an utter failure. Rhule was a stark departure from former head coach Ron Rivera;  He failed to conjure any sort of identity unique to his regime, and he wasn’t able to establish a successful culture while at the helm. A revolving door of coordinators and quarterbacks never let the young Panthers establish an identity on offense, and limited personnel continuously proved to suffocate their ability to create any sort of plays down the field. Joe Brady was a hot commodity coming out of the college coaching scene following a record setting year at LSU in 2019, and was Coach Rhule’s first choice to bring onto his staff and try to help provide a spark for a desperate Sam Darnold, and, later in the season, Cam Newton. Brady was unable to recreate the magic he made calling plays for Joe Burrow, as the offense under his control never performed better than a bottom third team in the league, falling so far as 29th in total offense and 24th in average scoring offense at the time of his firing in December of 2021. Brady was subsequently replaced by none other than revolutionary football mind Ben McAdoo. The combination of Rhule and McAdoo produced some of the worst offensive metrics of the season by any team up until Rhule’s firing in week 5, ranking dead last in total yards per game, offensive plays per game, and third down conversion rate up to that point.

    Steve Wilks, the defensive coordinator turned interim head coach, provided a surprising spark to the Panthers, at a time in which most outsiders considered them to be the worst in the league.	He rallied his team to end the season on a largely positive note, albeit one that would ultimately be short lived. Wilks finished the remaining schedule with a 6-6 record, picking up the broken pieces of the Rhule era and making the most of the hand he was dealt. A unique aspect to the back half of this season was the emergence of a physically imposing offensive line and a great run game to boot. The success found on the ground remains particularly interesting coming off of the Christian McCaffrey trade, in which the Panthers received picks in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th rounds, a massive haul to kickstart the construction of their future. Coach Wilks was able to grind out several wins by keeping it in the hands of his running backs, in an offense that saw a committee approach which featured excellent play from both D’Onta Foreman and Chuba Hubbard. The Panthers committed to keeping the ball out of their unreliable quarterback’s hands, and it largely paid off for them, as they salvaged their disappointing start into a 7-10 finish that saw the run game finish with top 12 rankings in rushing attempts per game, rushing yards per game, rushing attempts per game, and 13th in rushing TD’s. Ending the season in the top 1/3rd of rushing offenses is an impressive feat for any team, let alone a team who faced prospects as grim as the Panthers have at times this year. Their poor start to the year and ultimate lack of a passing attack left their total offensive production toward the very bottom of the league, but there was a clear silver lining to this season; The Panthers have established an incredible base to build an offense with the infrastructure capable of supporting a dominant run attack.

    The Panthers made the first splash hire in the coaching carousel, hiring former Indianapolis Colts head coach Frank Reich to a 4 year deal. Reich has a rich history with the Panthers, and although the hiring came seemingly out of the blue, there’s no denying the connection between the two parties. For instance, Frank Reich was the inaugural starting quarterback for the Panthers, appearing in the franchises first ever NFL game in 1995. He is an offensive minded coach who brings a vastly different type of leadership to the Panthers organization. Matt Rhule was hired to be a CEO type of coach, focusing on roster and culture building instead of being hands on with either side of the ball. Owner David Tepper has realized and even publicly acknowledged how this strategy failed him, as Rhule was incapable of producing a winning culture in the slightest. This move signifies that Tepper wants to take the Panthers in a direction that favors investments into the offensive side of the ball, and more particularly, at quarterback.

    Frank Reich has a rich history in dealing with some incredible quarterbacks during his coaching career, bringing out the best of Carson Wentz during his MVP season cut short to injuries in 2017, and has worked with the likes of Peyton Manning and Phillip Rivers (Chargers version). The Panthers are an obvious destination for a quarterback change, and they have a ton of options to choose from. Reich could decide to bring in a veteran to compete for the woeful title of NFC South champion alongside their young, blossoming defense. However, the way the winds are blowing suggest they’ll take a different approach. They’ve got plenty of ammunition to move up from their 9th pick in this years draft if they fall in love with one of the top quarterbacks like Bryce Young or Will Levis. After dishing McCaffrey to the 49ers, the Panthers are in a much better position to jump up in the draft to take a prospect they feel absolutely sure on, rather than settling for someone who may be lower on their draft board. The Chicago Bears have trade rumors swirling all over their first round pick, so it’s not out of the realm of possibilities that The Panthers would take a swing at the first pick with their new quarterback whisperer of a head coach. If the panthers don’t want to sell the farm for the 1st pick, the Seahawks and Lions are two teams sitting at 5th and 6th in the draft order, both of whom were the beneficiaries of surprisingly serviceable quarterback play from each of their respective signal callers, and both of whom would be eager to acquire more assets from a deal that the Panthers could offer.

    Sitting at 9th is also an option that is very much on the table for Reich. When asked about his preferences on playstyle, Coach Reich was not shy in the slightest about how he felt. He spoke about the transition towards a more “movement” style of quarterback he sees taking place in the NFL, and how he sees the value in being able to take advantage of play action and RPO style playcalling. During his tenure at the Colts, he started each year with a different quarterback. That’s 5 different starting quarterbacks in 5 years. Reich learned a lot about adapting to what he has in front of him, and although it ultimately didn’t translate to any real success in Indy, that experience will prove invaluable in approaching the plans for his next franchise quarterback, whoever it may be. If C.J. Stroud is available at #9, it would be hard for Reich to pass up on such a promising young quarterback falling into his lap. A player like Anthony Richardson, despite how incredibly raw of a prospect he is, absolutely deserves consideration for this pick if it comes down to it. He’s the best athlete at the position for the class, and has all the skills that you’d think a big time playmaker in the NFL would possess, just infinitely less refined. A coach like Reich, whose whole reputation revolves around his ability to get the most out of his quarterbacks, could elevate a player like Richardson into MVP caliber if given the proper time and resources.

    Frank Reich will not be receiving many positive things from Matt Rhule. One positive piece of Rhule’s roster building that Reich will absolutely take advantage of, however, is the defense. The Panthers defense entirely revamped itself under Rhule, with heavy investment on every level, from the defensive line to the secondary. Standouts in the defensive backfield like SS Jeremy Chinn, who finished 4th on the team in tackles and proved to be the heart and soul of the defense despite missing 6 games, or Jaycee Horn, who was drafted in 2021 and is already playing at an All-Pro level as a cornerback. 2021 free agent acquisition Frankie Luvu has rumbled onto the scene for the Panthers and produced some incredible production for them since given the opportunity. Luvu, a linebacker, had 111 tackles, including 19 for loss and 7 sacks, and sprinkled a defensive touchdown on top of his impressive resume this year. Matt Rhule’s prize gem, whom he chose with his first pick as Panthers head coach, Derrick Brown, came into his own this year as a dominant nose tackle who completely disrupts opposing gameplans. His ability to take up space and influence the run game enabled everyone around him to succeed, and his presence as the glue of the front seven was undeniable to those who watched him play in 2022. The building blocks to a dominant defense have been laid out by the previous regime, and the hiring of Reich works counter that in a positive way, allocating resources toward the least productive part of the team, the offense, and enables the people making decisions about player personnel to focus more on the offensive side of the ball, something they desperately need to do.

    Rhule and his GM, Scott Fitterer, were also able to make some quality signings and picks on the offensive side of the ball, even though they didn’t produce particularly well as a unit. There were some quietly awesome additions to the offensive line under Rhule, Bradley Bozeman stepped in at center for the injured Pat Elfein in week 7, and proved to be a dominant force in the run game. Next to Bozeman stood another addition from the 2021 offseason, guard Austin Corbett, who signed a 3 year deal with the team and started all 17 games. Both Corbett and Bozeman in addition to Rookie left tackle Ikem Ekwonu quickly transformed this unit into a formidable force. Ekwonu was already a physically gifted player who could easily dominate in the run game with his strength and athleticism coming out of college, but he continued to improve as a pass blocker throughout the season, and is proving to be every bit worthy of the #6 overall pick used to select him. This infrastructure will face some challenges, though, as Corbett tore his ACL in the season finale and faces extensive rehab. Bozeman also faces unrestricted free agency coming off of an impressive second half of the season, so teams will be eager to give him a call once the free agency period begins. If everything goes according to plan, however, with Corbett coming back healthy and Bozeman returning to bolster their interior, they have what they need to keep the momentum they built on the ground rolling into the 2023 season.

    The Carolina Panthers have come a long way from the Rivera and Newton saga, riding through the peaks and valleys that have come since he was fired late in the 2019 season after an amazing 9 years coaching for the Panthers, a tenure which reached its pinnacle in Super Bowl 50. Their new ownership made a few mistakes along the way, some of them a lot more costly than others, and some that have set their team back for a few years. But, after this failed attempt at a rebuild, there seems to be a palpable new energy in the air around Carolina, and with the arrival of Frank Reich, fans should be hopeful for positive change in the coming future. Reich did wonders in Indianapolis while facing some of the worst quarterback luck possible, and is inheriting a roster that has been silently building itself a formidable nucleus of young players on both the offensive and defensive sides of the ball. Reich will get his first real chance to construct his roster the way he would like, as his time in Indianapolis began with a roster that was hopeful to make the super bowl with Andrew Luck running the show. Coach Reich has grown leaps and bounds since his first year with Luck, and he has the opportunity to craft a truly special with the resources he now has at his disposal. Whether they stay put at pick #9, or they fall in love and move up to grab a quarterback in the top 4, Reich has first dibs on whoever he wants to fill his new offensive staff, and a lot of time to think about the path he wants to take. Whatever he chooses, he’s entering a situation that has the infrastructure for him to succeed, and it’s up to him to generate results.
