    The Chicago Bears have been, without a doubt, one of the most disastrous teams in the NFL since 2010. The Bears stuck to the roots of their past and constructed a couple of mediocre, but admittedly, fun teams with shoddy offensive production, backed by a defense that deserves so much better. The Cutler to Trubisky transition was about as dire as it could get for everyone involved; the fans famished for good football being led on by a 2018 season that, in retrospect, was a monumental outlier and a vast over achievement carried on the back of a crushing defense. After the mediocrity of the Cutler years, Bears fans had no choice but to put blind faith in a young quarterback who was in way over his head, after they watched their desperate front office trade an arm and a leg to move up from pick #3 to pick #2. In a trade with the 49ers, the Bears gave up their #3 pick, a second round pick, a third round pick, and a 4th rounder, to move just one spot. Some of the talent taken with those picks include two-time first-team All-Pro LB Fred Warner, and Alvin Kamara, the 2017 Rookie of the Year and a two-time second-team All-Pro.

    That sounds like a disaster, right? Like, the type of move that could set a franchise back for decades? If you answered yes, you and I are both in agreement. If that is the case, then surely the outlook on the future of the Bears franchise must be clouded by the bleak prospect of perpetual mediocrity that has already plagued the team for decades. Except, that statement could not be further from the truth. In the span of the last year and a half, the Bears have transformed from the laughingstock of the league into the popular kid at school, who everyone wishes they could emulate. Obviously, the qualities that others wish they could embody, both of the popular kid and the Bears, are vastly different and vastly unique to the people perceiving them. However, just as there are all different types of kids wishing they could be a little like the popular kid (for whatever reason), there are plenty of teams that wish they could be in the position that the Chicago Bears have put themselves in to secure a promising future. (Thank you for bearing with my ridiculous analogy.) Unanimously, throughout the league, the Bears are regarded as being the dictator of the outcome of the draft and in the driver’s seat for free agency. Teams like the Titans--or, you could argue, the Saints--are envious of the Bears. The Titans, middling around year in and year out, knowing that they are competitive enough to fight for a playoff spot, but also knowing they’re not built to escape past the second round. The Saints, flailing around without Drew Brees or Sean Payton, stuck with a bloated salary cap and a team good enough to keep you from receiving an impactful pick. The play of Justin Fields throughout the year, despite the gross inadequacy of his supporting cast, has fans across the league believing that he may be the best quarterback the Bears have ever had, in only two years and under two seasons worth of games played in his career. But how did the bears get here? How could the Bears, in just the span of around 5 years, alter the course of perpetual mediocrity they had set for themselves, and be regarded as a franchise with one of the brightest futures? That’s what I wanted to figure out, and as it turns out, it took a little bit of luck, and a lot of hard decisions. I’m going to do my best to map out the most impactful decisions that the Chicago bears have made to get here, and who is responsible for it.
</p>

<p>
    The first step that amounted to any sort of alteration to the course of mediocrity was the departure of Ryan Pace and Matt Nagy. These two carry a lot of emotional baggage in the hearts and minds of Bears fans, and for good reason. Pace was the architect of the trade that was mentioned earlier, and additionally, the conductor of almost all of the damage afflicted to this team since 2015. Pace hired John Fox, who achieved an underwhelming 14-34 record at the helm from 2015-2017. John Fox allegedly didn’t even know that the team he was coaching had plans to trade up and draft Mitchell Trubisky in 2017. Fox was ushered out of the door and in came the offensive prodigy from Kansas City, the great Matt Nagy. Already, it seems that the cognitive dissonance was showing.

<p>
    Pace thrust the responsibility of fostering Trubisky into a successful quarterback, depriving Nagy from the opportunity to pursue a quarterback that he would’ve preferred, and locked the success of the team into a contingency plan that ended in Nagy elevating Trubisky’s play to All-Pro levels. That, of course, didn’t pan out, as Nagy’s tenure was marred by and will be remembered for awful quarterback play and somehow even worse offensive production. Nagy seemingly took every opportunity to make Bears faithful pull their hair out, doing things like falling in love with the wildcat on the goal line, or throwing the ball 50+ times with Trubisky. He would move away from the run game at the times the Bears needed it to jumpstart their offense. He routinely ignored his players strengths and weaknesses and created a system that resulted in some of the worst offensive PPG statistics in the history of the franchise. When Matt Nagy handed play calling duties to OC Bill Lazor, the offense jumped almost 8 whole points, going from 19.8 points per game in the 2020 season to averaging 27.7. It’s safe to say that Nagy was in way over his head, and that assessment is charitable.

<p>
    The Chicago Bears 2021 season piddled out into misery as both Nagy and Pace were fired, with their 6-11 record landing them the #7 pick in a loaded first round. Except, they weren’t picking at 7, because in a last-ditch effort to save his job, his parting gift was a trade up with the New York Giants to grab Justin Fields, who slid all the way to #11. After about half a decade of malpractice, Pace made one of his only redeemable draft day decisions, and gave Chicago a chance at developing a quarterback with generational upside. Still though, the Bears were left with the broken pieces of a team who once held Super Bowl aspirations, and were now left directionless, with an age disparity leaving a huge margin of outcomes that could have a profound effect on how the team would decide to construct the new roster. 
</p>

<p>
    So how did the Bears flip the script? How did they go from a team in limbo, with superstars like Roquan Smith and Khalil Mack keeping the team afloat, to a team with a future full of prospect and hope?
</p>

<p>
    The answer lies solely in the decision by the McCaskey family to re-think their approach on constructing a front office. For as long as the bears have been running, the Halas/McCaskey family has been a lot more hands-on with football decisions than most fans would have liked. Whether it be the continued underspending in free agency to line the family’s pockets, or the painful mistakes suffered time and time again with the most valuable picks in the draft, it seems as if their decisions always lead to more mediocrity. 
</p>

<p>
    It’s unclear what truly led to the change of heart for the family that owns the Chicago Bears. Perhaps it was the continued call to sell the team from its most die-hard fans. Perhaps it was truly motivated by a distaste for losing. However they may have been inspired to change their ways, the decisions they made last offseason regarding their front office proved monumental to placing them into the position that they find themselves in going into free agency and the draft. 
</p>

<p>
    On January 25th, 2022, about a year ago, Ted Phillips, then acting CEO of the Chicago Bears, made the call to hire Ryan Poles. The Poles hire tells you everything you need to know about the nature of the direction that they’re looking to take the team towards, and is a great representation of how a hands-on ownership mentality is becoming a thing of the past, at least for the McCaskeys. Unlike previous GM hirings, the pretext with which Poles was hired under holds a lot more weight. The Bears had been trapped in a perpetual cycle of one regime cleaning up the mess the previous one had made, and ownership finally came to a breaking point with the results they had been getting. There had always been a major lack of consistency when it came to the head coach, the quarterback, and the general manager being on the same page, a concept that is absolutely crucial to building a championship culture.

<p>
    To change this, Ryan Poles was hired, and subsequently given absolute power to shape the franchise. His first move was perhaps the most indicative of the way the winds were blowing, as he immediately sent off 3x first-team All-Pro and 7x Pro Bowl edge rusher Khalil Mack. The young general manager, then 36, spoke confidently about the approach he had decided to take in reconstructing the roster, and this first move reinforced everything he had preached in his introduction. He spoke feverishly about building through the draft, making it clear he was not afraid to trade down to acquire as many picks as possible, as well as expressing a willingness to trade whoever he felt would give him a chance to add valuable picks to his arsenal. The departure of Mack returned a 2022 second-round pick as well as a 2023 sixth-round pick from the Chargers, compensation that had some fans feeling underwhelmed. Given the current market of edge rushers, especially of his capability, however, with Von Miller being traded to the Bills for a 2022 second- and third-round pick. Miller garnered slightly more compensation, but also was able to stay on the field more consistently than Mack, and had slightly more impressive production, so the disparity made sense. Poles turned the second-round pick into Jaquan Brisker, arguably one of the brightest young defensive players in the league by the end of the 2022 season. He turned the team’s day-3 picks into eight, and flushed his roster with hit-or-miss developmental talent.

<p>
    Luckily for Poles, it seems some of these shots in the dark will come to fruition for him. Offensive tackle Braxton Jones made a name for himself as one of the bright spots on an otherwise struggling offensive line, earning PFF All-Rookie honors as a 5th round pick out of Utah State. Poles also picked up another PFF All Rookie, scooping up UDFA Jack Sanborn from Wisconsin, a home-grown Illinois kid who has played phenomenally for the defense, especially after the trade deadline. The Bears continued to round out their trenches with quality role players who provided serviceable play at times, and gave each player ample room to develop their less refined qualities. Poles kept the same energy as he transitioned into the 2022 regular season. He chose to move on from All-Pro linebacker and defensive staple Roquan Smith at the deadline, along with edge rusher Robert Quinn, deals which garnished second- and fifth-round picks from the Ravens, and a fourth-round pick from the Eagles, respectively. He also chose to acquire Chase Claypool from the Steelers at the deadline, which should provide Fields with some crucial, albeit unproven help in a thin and problematic receiving corps going into the 2022 offseason. Poles has taken an aggressive approach to roster evaluation, and made some hard decisions to move on from talented players who have impacted the city of Chicago beyond just the football field, and invested in raw and promising young players whose skills on the field, coupled with time and a proper investment from the treasure trove of an estimated $118 million in salary room. 
</p>

<p>
    In addition to the seemingly relentless commitment Ryan Poles has shown to his philosophy, whether it be creating cap room or acquiring draft capital, or both, there has also been a considerable number of balls that have bounced his way, or in some cases, against him. After winning the first game of the season to the NFC Championship-bound 49ers, the Bears strung together some hard-fought losses against quality opponents, which is the unquestioned dream scenario for teams in their position. A 5-point loss to the Eagles, or a scrappy game against the Cowboys that could have ended up a lot closer had there not been an absurd fumble recovery by future DPOY Micah Parsons.

    Games like these are exactly what the Bears needed because they fall under a common theme. Justin Fields showcasing his ability to take over a game against dominant defenses establishes a positive -- dare I say, winning -- culture that can carry over into next year and affirms the trust that the front office and coaching staff have laid into their young quarterback. It’s an incredibly refreshing thing for Bears fans to take a look at the tale of the tape after a loss and to think to themselves that it was not because of their quarterback. In fact, most games left Bears fans feeling the exact opposite; they finally could make a confident argument that their quarterback, the most important position in football, was the player keeping them in the game. No longer leeching onto the back of a defense punching above its weight, a buzz of optimism in Chicago is starting to brew. For the first time in their modern history, the Bears are building themselves a path to success, by trusting their front office and putting their quarterback first.
</p>

<p>
    One last stroke of luck was all it took to seal the Bears’ fate as Mr. Desirable heading into the offseason. In week 18, the Lovie Smith-led Houston Texans shocked the world, launching and scoring on a Hail Mary play on a 4th-and-20 with under a minute left in their season--a season in which the Texans were arguably the worst team in football, as they had entered the game holding the #1 pick in the 2023 draft firmly in their possession, foreboding a loss. Those Texans then proceeded to convert a two-point try, taking a one point lead over the Colts with 58 seconds left, and hung on to win the game. The Super Bowl runner-up Bears head coach could be in line for a statue in front of the Bears’ proposed new stadium in a few years, because after this stunt, Lovie Smith had done his former team one last favor as the Bears leapfrogged the Texans and took ownership of the #1 pick.

    The Bears are staring down a pathway to an embarrassment of riches if they can play their hands correctly, and it’s all due to the incredible commitment and patience of Ryan Poles and his willingness to stick to his guns. He spoke to the media with confidence about the investment he wants to put into his bright young quarterback, and he has made the moves to put his team in a position to bolster their new star to his full potential. There is a whirlwind of speculation regarding how the Bears will treat this golden ticket that they’ve received in the #1 pick. A large sum of the media believes there is mutual interest from the Bears and other quarterback-needy organizations for the pick to be traded down. Others believe the Bears should take the top talent in the draft where they stand, like IDL Jalen Carter from Georgia or edge rusher Will Anderson Jr. from Alabama, both highly coveted prospects a team like the Bears could shape their defenses around. 
</p>

<p>
    Regardless of the results that come from these picks, or the fruit they bear from the free agency period, it’s undeniable that up to this point, approaching February 2023 and inching closer and closer to the important stretches of the offseason, Ryan Poles has done everything in his power to set his team up for success. Poles has pulled from his experience with the Chiefs organization and watching their rise to dominance and applied some of his most important takeaways to his philosophy. The jury is still out on whether or not his approach will work, but at the very least, Poles’ tenure so far has been a breath of fresh air for the fans of Chicago and it’s clear that there is a conscious and cohesive plan informed by people who truly want to succeed and are pulling from as many resources as they can to do so.
