    I am so sorry for all of the Jets fans across the world. You have to wake up every day and convince yourself that Zach Wilson is the guy. You have to live a life of misery that I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy. 
    The Jets had (2)! yards in the second half against the Patriots. To be fair, Belicheck absolutely owns the Jets, but at this point, the entire Zach Wilson experiment has to be looked at as an objective disaster. 
    Notice, I didn’t say failure, because I am a lifelong bears fan and I suffer from chronic optimism around young QB’s. But, man, he looks very rough. His pocket presence is atrocious. It looks like he is purposefully 
    desecrating the legacy of pocket movement every chance he gets. He always leaves early and when he does sense some pressure, he has no idea what to do about it.
</p>

<p>
    Normally, I wouldn’t be too worried about a young QB putting out a nasty stat line of 9-22 passing and 77 yards, but this is starting to become egregious. As an organization, if you are going to spend such valuable 
    draft capital on a quarterback, it’s under the assumption that at some point, that quarterback has to bring back a return on their investment relatively sooner rather than later. The player you pick should ideally 
    show you that to some capacity, he is capable of taking over a game and making decisions with the ball to put your team in a position to win the game. These instances are extremely rare to come by in the Zach Wilson 
    era of Jets football, and fans have got to be more frustrated than ever with him. The Jets defense has been an incredible bright spot for the team, with the scrappy Robert Saleh led unit even winning some games for 
    them this year. Sauce Gardner is already a player that offensive coordinators have to plan around, and the defensive line is destroying teams at the line of scrimmage thanks to the dominant play of Quinnen Williams 
    and Carl Lawson. This is the time that a young team like the Jets is supposed to be elevated by the play of their franchise QB, with all of the amazing things that scouts saw finally coming to fruition.
</p>

<p>
    Instead, the Jets find themselves succeeding in spite of their quarterback, winning games entirely on the ground (before Breece Hall got hurt) and with their defense. Instead, it seems like the Jets are scared of 
    Zach Wilson. They try to hide him with the play calling, and for a while, it was working. The roster they have is so talented already that they’ve been able to put out a 5-2 record while Wilson is the starter. 
    Injuries have slowly started to pile up, particularly on offense, which of course doesn’t benefit anyone involved, but at this point, the injuries can’t mask the nasty stench that permeates off of Zach Wilson. 
    Earlier, Breece Hall was an effective mask for Wilsons poor play. Now, however, Mike Lafleur is Breece Hall-less, and he can only scheme so much with the minimal talent that they’ve procured on offense.
</p>

<p>
    I have some more bad news for Jets fans. Mike White will not save you. Let me say it again for the people in the back who might not have heard me; Mike White will not save you. He looked Phenomenal against the 
    Bears; I’ll give you that. But that was against an already weak Bears unit who wasn’t fielding Kyler Gordon or Jaquon Brisker, both being huge key pieces for the Bears secondary. Mike White played against arguably 
    the least talented defensive unit anyone has scrounged together all year, and although he put up an impressive statline, he’s going to have to show a lot more against more disciplined defenses for me to believe him. 
    His track record consists of only a couple flashes in the pan. Let me be the one to remind you of his 0 touchdown, 4 interception performance against the bills in the last game he played in before the Bears game. 
    He scraped out a weird win at home against a Bengals team who hadn’t found their identity yet. Other than that, he’s done nothing to show the Jets that he can carry the load like they need him to, and to think that 
    he can be that guy up to this point is unfortunately a pipe dream.
</p>

<p>
    All of this sets up an interesting narrative going into the offseason. The Jets have a ton of active capital invested into the players on their roster, with very little in dead money in comparison to some other teams 
    in a similar position, and at least on the defensive side, it’s working out well. But with this stagnation at the quarterback position, there will be a fork in the road at some point. The Jets are sitting at 7-4 and 
    knocking on the door of a playoff birth, on the back of an elite defense and in spite of subpar quarterback play. They either need Zach Wilson to commandeer the ship and create one of the all-time turnarounds the 
    sport has ever seen, or they need to look elsewhere. The ladder seems like a much more likely and frankly optimistic outcome up to this point. But if you want to transcend from playoff contention to Super Bowl contention, 
    the quarterback position needs to see a significant change.

    But what would that change entail? Is there another QB in the draft for the Jets to snatch up and pray he develops? Will the Jets make a hire akin to someone like Pep Hamilton, the Offensive Coordinator for the Texans who 
    has a great history developing young QB’s? Or will the Jets look to move some capital around and shop for a veteran?

    It seems like the only path forward that makes sense for the current timeline of the Jets is to find a more experienced quarterback who can be a leader in the locker room and play at least decent football. The football 
    that is being played by the current Jets quarterbacks is absolutely not on par with the rapidly increasing trajectory of this team. With an elite defense that is far succeeding any preseason expectations, the Jets front 
    office has got to feel a little pressure to capitalize on it. This type of magic doesn’t come around too often. I thought of some players the Jets could make a call about and this is the small group I came up with:
</p>

<h2>Derek Carr, LV Raiders; 2 1sts for Carr</h2>

<p class="no-indent">
    This is the move that makes the most sense on both sides for me. If the Jets end up making a playoff run, it's likely that their pick will be in the early to mid-20’s. I think the Raiders are looking at a roster implosion 
    very soon, with the Josh Mcdaniels experiment failing miserably for the second time now. The Jets could offer this year’s 1st and next year's 1st and get a Super Bowl ready quarterback without sacrificing too much capital 
    that they could use to improve their roster. Derek Carr is the type of player who has the talent to add 3 or 4 wins to this Jets roster, and that’s a really big deal. He would give the Jets a greater margin of error and 
    allow them to reach their true ceiling, utilizing all the talent on their offense as they should be. I think I would bet everything I own that Mike Lafleur would be elated to have Dereck Carr in that locker room.
</p>

<h2>Jimmy Garoppolo, SF 49ers, Free Agency</h2>

<p class="no-indent">
    Now, let me be clear. Jimmy G would not be my first choice. I don’t really think he’s got the capability to win you a game like some of the other QB’s in the league, but Jimmy is a player that more often than not won’t 
    lose you the game, which is the type of QB the Jets are yearning for right now. Jimmy G is a veteran who knows what it takes to win on the biggest stage, whether you like it or not. He’s been to a Super Bowl and 3 NFC 
    championship games, and that type of experience could be just what the Jets need to get themselves into the next echelon of competitive teams. He is someone who has all the tools to play decent football and elevate this 
    roster a little bit, just what Saleh needs.
</p>

<h2>Geno Smith, SEA Seahawks, Free Agency</h2>

<p class="no-indent">
    Jets fans… Listen… I know what you’re thinking right now after reading that. That might’ve been a headline you read in a nightmare you had in 2019. But I think there’s something you need to admit to. You know it, and I 
    know it. Geno is not a bad quarterback anymore. This year, the Seahawks have shocked the world, and all roads lead back to Geno. Before this year, people were saying that the Seahawks might have the worst roster that 
    has ever been put onto a football field, and I’m not kidding! That chatter was thrown in the garbage this year after the Seahawks have been the division leader almost all year, with Geno’s accuracy and decision making 
    being the most unexpected highlights of the year. He’s been holding onto the ball well, with a 19:5 TD to INT ratio, with a QB of 107.9 and an adjusted QBR of 64.2, placing him at the FIFTH best quarterback in the league 
    this year. According to those numbers, he’s been better than Lamar Jackson, Justin Herbert, Aaron Rodgers, Tom Brady, Kyler Murray, Dak Prescott, Dereck Carr, Joe Burrow, and Matthew Stafford. I know that numbers don’t 
    tell the whole story, but you have to concede that Geno Smith has been incredible this season. After how poorly things went the last time the Jets trotted him out to start, what could go wrong?

    The Jets are staring down the barrel of mediocrity for the rest of this decade if they don’t get their quarterback situation figured out. Good teams don’t get to hang around forever, and the Jets accelerated window is 
    only going to be open for so long. Saleh and the front office definitely have their work cut out for them with the future of the franchise.
